# AI Social Media Backend

## Description
This is the backend component to UnAI: a web project that functions similarly to a social media platform like facebook or twitter, but instead of interacting with other users, all replies and comments are generated by an OpenAI model.

Repo for the frontend component can be found [here](https://github.com/jChenvan/ai-followers-frontend)

## Features
- Character creation: Create custom followers by entering a name and character description.
- Posts: AI comments are automatically generated upon post creation.
